            <p>I LOVE skiing. My father being a ski teacher, I grew up in the Swiss mountains and participated in competitions. I really like going to see the articles and videos on ski races, like on SRF News for example!</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I like art in all its forms, whether it's dancing, singing, painting, or creating music with my voice and piano. In parallel, I enjoy practicing sports like volley-ball, skiing, and swimming. Spending time with my friends is essential to me. </p>

            <h2>Passions</h2>

            <p>My passion is reading above all else!! I particularly love the writing style of Jean-Claude Mourlevat or Stephen King. But my favorite book remains, above all, 'La Tresse' by Laetitia Colombani. Otherwise, I really like learning languages: for the moment I master 6 and I intend to learn a 7th!!!</p>

            <p>As a first-year student at IESEG, I am dedicated to a future filled with academic success, international exposure, and networking. My goal is to excel in my studies, explore global opportunities and build a strong professional network. My vision includes entrepreneurial ventures, social impact projects, and a focus on career advancement. I particularly have a keen interest in luxury hotel management.
